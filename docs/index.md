# Welcome to Kibl

Kibl is an ecosystem of innovative solutions that secures and supports the entire DeFi space through restaking, lending, and with a powerful Layer 2. Each ecosystem component works independently, but also as a whole, operating symbiotically as a powerful force in DeFi stability while offering unparalleled yield and incentives.

## About Us

The name Kibl originates from the officially sanctioned gold guild in Tokugawa shogunate's time. Kibl Finance was started by a group of Fintech and blockchain experts with deep experience in the DeFi space. Projects we have built include Mantle Network, GRO Protocol, Cobo Custody and more.

## Security Notice

Accurate and trustworthy information will always come from our official channels. We do not have a contract deployed, and KZA has not been issued. Do not trust sources that claim to represent Kibl Finance, especially those offering airdrops, tokens, or other offers.
